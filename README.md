# Voice Synthesis Using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)

Executed a machine learning project focused on generating Mel spectrogram images from speech data to synthesize voice and speaking styles. Utilized DC-GANs for transforming 1-second speech samples of the word 'zero' from multiple speakers. Responsibilities included data preprocessing with Librosa, spectrogram normalization, and designing CNN architectures for the discriminator and generator in the GAN model.
